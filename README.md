### WIMP Full Stack Project V2

GoForCode Homework Project for January 4th

Curretly works with Travis-CI Automation Depoying to Heroku (Deployment Details Below) for both Front-End and Back-End App components.

In this project, we were provided with a starter Angular 4 App with multiple components interacting with the Movies class in the WIMP API. The assignment was to add in additional components (Actors, Awards) and to tweak the Home Page UI.
